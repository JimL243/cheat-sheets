# Sourcetree and GitHub Settings
To connect Sourcetree to your github account you need a personal access token. Thoe can be generated [here on the Github site](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)

Once you have your token you can connect to your repo in this manner:
https://<personal-access-token>@github.com/<my-repo-url>

Alternatively, users are reporting that installing GIT helps too:
